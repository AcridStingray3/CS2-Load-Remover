# CS2 Load Remover
A load remover for The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 2

Split functions were planned for bosses' healths, but this proved to not be quite doable due to the game reusing pointers for other enemies, sometimes to the point where it'd reassign them mid fight, instead of keeping some for exclusively boss fights.

# How to Install

- Open Livesplit, go to Edit Layout > Hit the big "+" > Control > Scriptable Autosplitter.

- Go into layout settings > Scriptable Auto Splitter > Browse and select the asl file downloaded

- Make sure to set Current Comparison to Game Time on Livesplit (Right click > Compare against > Game Time)

# Special Thanks

I would like to thank 5fiftysix6 for putting up with my constant rants and even providing help based on them, Schtolteheim, for sharing his experience from working on Cold Steel 1 with me, and especially Ogam, for answering general questions I had with an immense amount of information and alternatives to what I was trying to do that would be even better, seemingly every time.
