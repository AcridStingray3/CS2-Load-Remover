# Special Thanks

I would like to thank 5fiftysix6 for putting up with my constant rants and even providing help based on them, Schtolteheim, for sharing his experience from working on Cold Steel 1 with me, and especially Ogam, for answering general questions I had with an immense amount of information and alternatives to what I was trying to do that would be even better, seemingly every time.
